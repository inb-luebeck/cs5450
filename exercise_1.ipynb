    "## Exercise 1.1: Applying unsupervised methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will apply three unsupervised methods, namely *Prinicipal Component Analysis (PCA)*, *Independent Component Analysis (ICA)*, and *Sparse Coding (SC)* to image patches taken from handwritting digits and from faces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since implementing [ICA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.FastICA.html) and [SC](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.SparseCoder.html) is rather complex, we will use already existing python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build on the python starter code given below. You only need to write code at the places indicated by `TODO`.\n",
    "The two given datasets are `mnist.npz` for handwritten digits and `olivetti.npz` for faces. Each dataset contains a multi dimensional array `data` with the first index corresponding to the observations and the second index corresponding to the features (grayscale pixels). Both datasets contain square-shaped images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the missing parts below. When done correctly, your code should do the following:\n",
    "1. Load the dataset with either handwritten images or faces.\n",
    "2. Enforce mean-free observations by subtracting the mean from the data.\n",
    "3. Randomly draw square-shaped image patches from the data.\n",
    "4. Apply one of the three unsupervised methods (PCA, ICA, or SC).\n",
    "5. Show the resulting set of new basis vectors (i.e. the components for PCA and ICA).\n",
    "6. Reconstruct the original image patches with different subsets of basis vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for sparse coding, the basis vectors are not ordered according to some metric (*unlike which method?*). To quickly reconstruct an image with only $i$ non-zero values, you should use the coefficients and basis vectors corresponding to the $i$ highest absolute coefficients (see [numpy.argsort](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.argsort.html)). \n",
    "\n",
    "In case you are struggeling with the task, here are some helpful tips and hints:\n",
    "1. Useful functions: [`numpy.load`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.load.html), [`ndarray.astype`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.astype.html), [`numpy.mean`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html), [`numpy.linalg.pinv`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.pinv.html), [`numpy.matmul`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.matmul.html), [`numpy.stack`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.stack.html), `random_patches`, `show_in_grid`, [`PCA`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html), [`FastICA`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.FastICA.html#sklearn.decomposition.FastICA), [`DictionaryLearning`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.DictionaryLearning.html#sklearn.decomposition.DictionaryLearning),[numpy.argsort](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.argsort.html)\n",
    "2. You should start with both PCA and ICA and only then use SC.\n",
    "3. Applying SC may take a couple of minutes. Good initial value for it are: \n",
    " - `dataset='mnist'`\n",
    " - `n_patches=1000`\n",
    " - `patch_size=25`\n",
    " - `n_basis=100`\n",
    " - `n_iterations=50`\n",
    " - and instantiate the class with `n_jobs=-1` to utilize all CPU cores, as well as `verbose=True` to see progress feedback"
